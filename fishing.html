<div id="whyfish">
<p id="fishone"> One of the many sports I like is fishing.
I used to go fishing often but now I go fishing less. 
This is because I have many studies to complete like Maths, 
Science and my favourite Digital Technologies.
These classes take up time and effort. 
This website I made for Digital Tech took Me a decent number of hours. 
What I like most about fishing is just when the fish pulls on the 
line and I must hook the fish and reel it in. When I reel the line 
in I must be careful so the line doesn't snap.The line isn't very 
thick because if it was, the fish would be able to see it and I 
wouldn't catch anything. My favourite way of fishing is called cast 
and retrieve. This is when I cast the rod and reel it in slowly. When 
casting and retrieving, I use a lure because if I used bait, it most likely will 
come off when I retrieve. I like fishing with my cousin because we sit 
and talk and fish. It's a great combination!</p>
